# 0.1.1 (06.07.16)
- bugfix: effective genome size was way off for hg38
- add danRer7 and danRer10 genomes

# 0.1.0 (20.06.16)
- speed up writing matrix to file

# 0.0.10 (11.06.16)
- remove support for .bam files, use bed/bedpe instead

# 0.0.9 (10.06.16)
- store matrixes of counts per bin for chip and input with flag --store-matrix <outfile_prefix> (these files can be massive, might be slow)
- use median readlength to find effective genome size, not mean

# 0.0.8 (24.05.16)
- add snakemake-workflow to get all genome data (thanks Ryan Dale)
- new flag: effective genome length
- epic now automatically finds the correct effective genome size
- effective genome sizes updated, will lead to slightly different results
- internal: add chromsizes to package and use pkg_utils to get them
- fix bug: used bedToBam when meant to call bamToBed

# 0.0.7 (06.05.16)
- fix default value of keep duplicates (was True, now is False)
- fix max-gap bug (max gap used was actually max-gap - 1)
- (internal: no more functions with > 5 arguments)
- (the difference between SICER and epic I thought was a due to a bug, was caused
  by them having different genome versions as default)

# 0.0.6 (10.04.16)
- add script to compute the effective genome size (thanks to Heng Li for alerting me to the existence of jellyfish2)

# 0.0.5 (07.04.16)
- remove Pandas only option. Now unix is required.
- change to argparse instead of docopt (thanks Dario Beraldi)
- separate args for control and input files (thanks Dario Beraldi)
- print cl-args exactly as recieved (thanks to Istvan Albert for pointing out glitch)
- add version info
- add support for bam files (requires bedtools)
- fix "bug" that prints chromosome start and end in output as floats.
- change output format to use tab as delimiter and underscore as within name delimiter ("P_value", not "P value")
